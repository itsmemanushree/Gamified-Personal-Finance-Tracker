## Usage

Users will be presented with the Home Page of the application. User can choose to login/sign up. Upon successful login/sign up, they can view their Profile which shows transaction history and allow them to post new transaction or set new budget by clicking on respective buttons. Users can also set their own Challenges under Challenge tab by clicking Add Challenge button. The challenge page displays list of users challenge if any with the completion status. We used Express-session to save user session and authenticated the application using middleware.

## CSS Framework Implementation

To build out this project, we used the CSS framework Bulma. Bulma is a free and open-source CSS framework that is used to create responsive and modern web designs. It is based on Flexbox to create easy and responsive grid layouts. 

We used a range of pre-designed UI elements, such as forms, buttons, heros, and modals, that were easily customized to fit the needs of our project. We primarily relied on the classes associated with layouts, `columns` Thanks to the built in responsiveness, we only needed a few media queries to obtain our desired styling.
